Resume Description
Steganography Software for Secure Data Encoding and Decoding

Designed and developed a steganography application capable of embedding sensitive data into .bmp images and retrieving it securely.
Implemented a robust encoding mechanism using a magic string as an authentication key, ensuring only authorized users can decode the embedded data.
Encoded metadata including file extension, file size, and message size, followed by the actual text data, enabling seamless reconstruction of the original file during decoding.
Automated the decoding process to create output files with the original extension and content, preserving the integrity of embedded information.
Utilized file handling, bitwise operations, and efficient data storage techniques to achieve high data concealment with minimal image distortion.
LinkedIn Description
I developed a steganography application that enables secure data embedding and retrieval using .bmp images as the medium. The project implements a magic string as an authentication mechanism to restrict unauthorized access. The encoding process includes embedding metadata such as file extension and size, followed by the actual data, ensuring seamless file reconstruction during decoding. This solution showcases my skills in algorithm design, data security, and efficient handling of file formats, making it a practical tool for secure data transmission and storage.
