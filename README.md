# Steganography Software for Secure Data Encoding and Decoding

Designed and developed a steganography application capable of embedding sensitive data into .bmp images and retrieving it securely.
Implemented a robust encoding mechanism using a magic string as an authentication key, ensuring only authorized users can decode the embedded data.
Encoded metadata including file extension, file size, and message size, followed by the actual text data, enabling seamless reconstruction of the original file during decoding.
Automated the decoding process to create output files with the original extension and content, preserving the integrity of embedded information.
Utilized file handling, bitwise operations, and efficient data storage techniques to achieve high data concealment with minimal image distortion.
